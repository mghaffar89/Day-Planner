1. Time blocks from bootstrap for hours 9-5
2. create display time in the header for ID current Day (moment JS?)
3. .past class - create a function that compares current time to the time block so it changes the styling
4. .present class - a function that compares current time to the time block
5. .future class - function that compares current time to the time block
6. the three classes could be listed in a if/else statement so the time block changes accordingly dpending on current time
7. create a local storage function which lets the user save the text written in text block and will always be there unless local storage is cleared or its the next day
8.
