To Do:

1. Time blocks from bootstrap for hours 9-5
2. create display time in the header for ID current Day (moment JS?)
3. .past class - create a function that compares current time to the time block so it changes the styling
4. .present class - a function that compares current time to the time block
5. .future class - function that compares current time to the time block
6. the three classes could be listed in a if/else statement so the time block changes accordingly dpending on current time
7. create a local storage function which lets the user save the text written in text block and will always be there unless local storage is cleared or its the next day
8.

Random Logic:

if data-hour equals current time then add class present
if data hour is less than current time then add class past
if data hour is more than current time then add class future
but what selectors to use?
choose a common id from the time slots to use in the function

need to change html elements into variables to use in JS/JQ

\*\*\*parseInt method to create string and integers

I DONT KNOW WHATS WRONG

Completed:

3. create a local storage function which lets the user save the text written in text block and will always be there unless local storage is cleared or its the next day
