# Day-Planner - HW 5

## Description

Built for employees with a busy schedule. This easy to use Daily Planner will allow users to manage time efficiently.
This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
Using a new library called Moment.js I was able to manipulate time elements and get them to show on the user interface.

Challenges that were faced was coming up with the correct function or method to get the app to display present, past and future times slots. I believe I got the majority of the code correct but I was having trouble with selectors and using the right elements to control. In the future I would like to add a manual check mark box or completed option so the user can also keep track of tasks or events that have already happened even if the time slot has not allotted.
